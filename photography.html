<h1>Photography</h1>

<p>My father, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftapia.com">Frank Tapia</a>, is commercial photographer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I started apprenticing him in 2004, carrying his gear. As time went on I started to interact with clients more. Doing Photoshop editing on the spot and helping them with photo selection. Eventually I was able to contribute to composition and run photoshoots myself.</p>

<p>After Steph and I moved to Phoenix, I would continue to fly back and forth to help him with big jobs. In November of 2018 Stephanie and I started to work in the Phoenix area, building our own photograph business, Berg &amp; Tapia. It was an excellent supplement to our dance careers.</p>

<p>Because of pandemic, we discontinued.</p>
