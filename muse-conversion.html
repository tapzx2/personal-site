                <h1>Helping My Dad with His Website</h1>

<p>My Dad made is website wayyyyy back. As far back as when digital photography was first coming out. I think he originally laid his site out in Quark Express. The most recent version he built was using the recently discontinued Adobe Muse. Now, he can't update it anymore.</p>

<p>The combination of covid, unused vacation days, and an out of town spouse meant it was the perfect time to help with this project.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The goals were to make it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Maintainable by future me</li>
<li>As similar as possible</li>
<li>Add a few design updates</li>
</ol>

<h2>Result</h2>

<p><em>index.html after</em>
<a target="_blank" href="https://tapzx2.github.io/ftapia-dev/">visit update</a></p>

<p>Pretty close! The big design changes were increasing the font size, adding a drop-shadow, and collapsing the SEO content.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<h3>Rewrite?</h3>

<p>The first thing I looked into was if I could maintain his website without having to rewrite the whole thing. After 15 minutes if poking around, I was convinced I needed to remake it.</p>

<p><em>thanks, no thanks</em></p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The design process was fairly straight forward, since most of the decisions were already made. However, I knew I would have to tackle tablet and mobile platforms so before writing anything I pushed a few pixels around in Figma.</p>

<p>Satisfied I had solutions to different screen sizes I made a proof of concept and showed it to Dad. Pleased, he asked me to finish the rest of his site.</p>

<h3>Collapsing SEO Content</h3>

<p>I'm no SEO expert. My Dad's research showed you need to have your keywords on your pages. A lot. So much for minimalism!</p>

<p>Over the years there have been attempts to hide the SEO content away. Tricks like making your font color the same as your background makes Google's robots unhappy. But the don't seem to mind :hover or accordions.</p>

<h3>Python to the Rescue</h3>

<p>The main challenge that I'm proud to have overcome on this project was saving time. There are a LOT of photos on his website and I had zero interest in tracking down each photo by its path path and matching it up in the right order with the mini images on the portfolio page.</p>

<p>Instead, I used python to convert the Muse styled HTML into what I needed. Then, I copied over the whole images folder as it was already structured.</p>

<p><em>32 x 2 = 64 images on this page alone</em></p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class=&quot;SSSlide clip_frame grpelem wp-panel&quot; data-col-pos=&quot;0&quot; id=&quot;u799475&quot; style=&quot;height: 621px; display: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- image --&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; data-col-pos=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;images/1%20san%20francisco%20beauty%20portrait%20photography954x636.jpg?crc=3877161937&quot; src=&quot;images/1%20san%20francisco%20beauty%20portrait%20photography954x636.jpg?crc=3877161937&quot; alt=&quot;Advertising Photographer San Francisco_www.ftapia.com&quot; title=&quot;Advertising Photographer San Francisco Bay Area&quot; data-heightwidthratio=&quot;0.6673662119622246&quot; data-image-width=&quot;953&quot; data-image-height=&quot;636&quot; id=&quot;u799475_img&quot; data-widget-id=&quot;slideshowu724&quot; style=&quot;height: 621.318px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- + hundreds more --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Became this:</p>

<pre><code class="html">&lt;img    src=&quot;images/1%20san%20francisco%20beauty%20portrait%20photography954x636.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Advertising Photographer San Francisco_www.ftapia.com&quot; title=&quot;Advertising Photographer San Francisco Bay Area&quot;    id=&quot;u799475_img&quot;  &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">to_remove = [
  '\&lt;div.*',
  '\&lt;\/div&gt;',
  'class=&quot;block&quot;',
  'data-col-pos=&quot;0&quot;',
  'data-src=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  'data-image-height=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  'data-heightwidthratio=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  'data-image-width=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  'style=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  'data-widget-id=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;',
  '\?.+?(?=&quot;)',
  'data-col-pos=&quot;.+?(?=&quot;)&quot;'
]

removed = data
for item in to_remove:
  removed = re.sub(item, '', removed)
cleaned = [line for line in removed.split('\n') if line.strip() != '']
print('\n'.join(cleaned))
</code></pre>

<p>I also used python to clean the html and then zip the two columns of mini images into one row, preserving the order.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The list is long. Here's my top 5. But, I'm happy to have a fun project that helps my Dad out!</p>

<ul>
<li>Condense / refactor CSS</li>
<li>Make the photo transitions ease in / out</li>
<li>Add a pause button to the auto slide show</li>
<li>Make the small browser and mobile versions</li>
<li>Switch from http to https</li>
</ul>
