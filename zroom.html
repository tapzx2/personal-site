    <h1>Z Room Dance &amp; Filming</h1>

    <p>
      In 2015 my wife and I bought a dance studio. Like many studios, it was
      organized around a central teacher who was the driving force of marketing
      and teaching. For us it was not sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>We changed the business model.</p>

    <p>
      As dance teachers we had rented space and always found the process
      difficult. Generally, dancers *really* don't want to fill out insurance
      forms, have lengthy back and forth conversations about availability, or
      heaven forbid, pay with a cheque. The Z Room makes it easy to rent a
      creative space at a low cost.
    </p>

    <p>We are actively searching for a location to open a third studio.</p>
