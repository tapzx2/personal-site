                <h1>Hello Culdesac Team!</h1>

                <h2>Background</h2>

                <h4>Why I'm Re-Applying</h4>

                <p>Ryan Johnson informed me you're looking for an intern with real estate and planning experience. Someone who knows about entitlements, real estate development, cities etc.</p>

                <p>When I submitted my resume a few weeks ago, I was so excited to see the internship opportunity I sent my general resume. Since then my resume has been customized to show my experience working on geographic data analysis, city planning, and real estate in California and Arizona. Please give it another look!</p>

                <h4>A Mission I Can Believe In</h4>

                <p>On paper, Culdesac is a real estate company. Nothing to be excited about. In reality, you're saving the world.</p>

                <p>The extreme level of care that has been put into delivering a quality product, that does actual good, is apparent.</p>

                <p>Culdesac is leveraging capitalism to profitably deliver a save-the-world product. That's exactly what Elon Musk is doing with Space X, Tesla, and Neuralink. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/03/elon-musk-post-series.html">But Wait, Why</a> did some great articles on that if you're interested.</p>

                <p>It is why I signed up to be founding resident at Eastline Village and why I'm applying to this internship.</p>

                <h4>Cultural Fit</h4>

                <p>I couldn't say if I'd actually fit in there, I haven't met any of you or participated in the work place dynamic. I can say that there are a number of things we align on.</p>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Feminism</strong>: Culdesac posted on Instagram that it was proud to achieve the gender parity. I read books that investigate gender, culture, and sexism like:

                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talking-Women-Work-Deborah-Tannen/dp/0380717832">Talking from 9 to 5: Women and Men at Work</a> by Deborah Tannen Ph.D.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Come-You-Are-Surprising-Transform/dp/1476762090">Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life</a> by Emily Nagoski Ph.D.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419">Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead</a> by Bren√© Brown</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Startup Culture</strong>: Culdesac participates in startup weeks and uses the work 'hack', appropriately and unironically.

                <ul>
                <li>I've worked in 3 startups.</li>
                <li>I've been a small business owner for the last 5 years, I'm comfortable doing what needs to be done even if I'm no expert.</li>
                <li>I'm prepping for a job in tech.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Bicycles</strong>: I'm fairly certain bikes are a thing at Culdesac.

                <ul>
                <li>I ride and (attempt to) maintain a <a href="https://bikehistory.org/catalogs/1969.html">1969 Schwinn Varsity Tourist</a> that I bought from a used bike shop in Berkeley, CA. It looks pretty beat, but that's the way I like it because otherwise I'm afraid someone will try to steal it.</li>
                <li>My first internship was volunteering at a bicycle advocacy group in the Bay Area.</li>
                <li>My first GIS project at USC was a bikeablity analysis of the Bay Area by zip code.</li>
                </ul></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Questions You Might Have</h2>

                <h4>Why is there that big gap in your resume?</h4>

                <p>My wife and I won the US Argentine Tango National Championship together in 2014 and we decided to pursue an artists career. We have performed, taught, and competed internationally. We have pursued photography. We opened 2 dance studios. Our motivation to pursue a dance career has been winding down since 2019. Our dance studios run themselves and photography isn't something either of us would like to peruse as a full time business, but we are very happy to have learned the skill. Since Covid 19 I've been focused on studying front end development.</p>

                <h4>If you're studying front end development, why are you applying to Culdesac?</h4>

                <p>I'm still pretty flexible since I don't have a job, yet. I'm currently focused on studying and I have time to pursue passion projects such as this internship.</p>

                <h4>Do you have experience with entitlements, real estate development, cities, etc?</h4>

                <p>Ryan Johnson mentioned to me these were the things you were looking for. To be honest, I had never heard of entitlements before. With an afternoon of research I found that I do have experience with parts of the entitlement process.</p>

                <p>As I've come to understand, entitlements are a potentially large source of risk for developers. They cover a variety of agencies and processes including:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Federal, State, and Regional Agency Requirements</li>
                <li>Comprehensive Plan / General Plan</li>
                <li>Zoning</li>
                <li>Land Development Regulations</li>
                <li>Permits</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Most of my experience comes in the form of research, data gathering, and data organization for companies. I have used that skill to make informed decisions for my own brick and mortar business. I do not yet have experience lobbying the city for changes.</p>

                <p>I have read many comprehensive and general plans, it is something we often did in the city planning intensive at UC Berkeley. When deciding where to move in 2015, I also reviewed Phoenix's general plan to make sure it was a reasonably well run city.</p>

                <p>I'm familiar with reading zoning permissions and land use regulations. More recently, the details of which I've had to research when assessing the risk exposure of our (relatively) unique business model. I'm most familiar with the spatial layers that cities provide that define their zoning requirements.</p>

                <p>I have no experience with land development regulations or permits.</p>

                <p>I'm very confident with acquiring and using spatial information. I'm comfortable interacting with bureaucratic organizations and <a href="https://www.tempe.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=78664">finding information</a>.</p>

                <p>I understand that the entitlement process is not always a straight forward, tiered system. Interdependent systems, where each level can prevent a project from moving forward and not all reviewing agencies share the same perspective on approval criteria, are something that I have dealt with a lot in computer programing. Admittedly, the documentation is better in the computer development field, but I'm confident I could fit the puzzle pieces together of an interdependent entitlement system.</p>

                <h4>What immediate value can you bring?</h4>

                <p>After a few informational interviews with commercial real estate agents, the skills I would be able to bring to the position immediately are research and knowledge summarization. I am proficient at finding information about zoning, permits, citizen engagement culture, city council member cell phone numbers (that one might take a little time), etc. and presenting it efficiently to whoever needs it.</p>

                <p>I've been told that real estate offices and large developers generally have the tools to do site suitability analyses, allowing them to narrow their list of potential properties down. However, then each property still needs to be investigated. I can do and / or support that investigation process.</p>

                <h4>Did you really just put being a home owner as real estate experience?</h4>

                <p>Typical US home ownership comes with a lot of emotional baggage. We committed ourselves to avoiding as much of it as possible. Buying land and property is a serious investment of capital and time. When selecting a home to buy we did a lot of financial and location due diligence, approaching its a real estate investment instead of as an emotional purchase.</p>

                <p>We did site suitability analyses for regions with these layers:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Proximity to transit</li>
                <li>Proximity to grocery stores</li>
                <li>Average rental income</li>
                <li>Census income data</li>
                <li>Violent crime data</li>
                <li>Number of mature trees</li>
                <li>Proximity to popular commercial districts</li>
                <li>Nearby commercial property vacancy rates</li>
                <li>Energy efficiency (solar panels)</li>
                <li>Proximity to city services</li>
                <li>Proximity to well rated schools</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It was a lot of work and so far we have been rewarded for it. Expenses are low, we've never had trouble getting housemates, and our neighborhood has appreciated significantly since we bought our home. I recently saw via Instagram that a member of your staff selected this neighborhood as a good location as well!</p>

                <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider me again!</p>

                <p>Best,</p>
