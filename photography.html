    <h1>Photography</h1>

    <p>
      My father,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftapia.com">Frank Tapia</a>, is
      commercial photographer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I started
      apprenticing with him in 2004 by mostly carrying his gear. As time went on
      I started to interact with clients, doing Photoshop editing on the spot,
      and helping with photo selection. Eventually I was able to contribute to
      composition and run photo shoots myself.

      After Steph and I moved to Phoenix, I continued to occasionally fly to
      California to assist with big jobs. In November of 2018 Stephanie and I
      started to build our own photography business, Berg &amp; Tapia. It was an
      excellent supplement to our dance careers. We ended the business when the
      pandemic started.

    <p>Because of pandemic, we discontinued.</p>
