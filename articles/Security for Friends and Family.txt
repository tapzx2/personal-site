# Security for Friends and Family

This article is my standard advice to friends and family (and acquaintances) when they ask me for cyber security tips.

The first thing I can offer you is a mindset shift. If you've ever been robbed, you know it could happen again, but you do what you can to minimize the probability and setup systems to mitigate the risk. Computer security is the same way. This isn't to make you afraid, it is help you be you aware, alert, and prepared.

1. Assume you are a (random) target.
2. Make it easy for yourself to be (more) secure.
3. Assume every company will be hacked.
4. Know (and be OK) with the fact you can never be 100% secure.

#### 1. Random Target
There are automated programs that scan the internet and send malicious emails / texts / fb messages / etc. These programs don't really check if you are broke or a Fortune 500 CEO.

#### 2. Make It Easy

Use security systems that aren't difficult or convoluted. The more convenient, the less difficulty you'll have continuing to use them.

#### 3. Assume a Breach

Check if your email or phone was in a data breach. [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) tracks some of these breaches. My email has been involved in 9 separate company breaches (i.e. Adobe, LinkedIn, Dropbox...). Those are just the disclosed ones! Just assume every company will be hacked at some point.

#### 4. You Can't Be 100% Secure

You can never be 100% secure. The point is be secure enough that you aren't an easy target. If some advanced hacking agency wants to take you down, you probably won't be able to stop them.  If they really wanted to, they could put months of effort and millions of dollars worth of expenses into doing it. Eventually they would get you. But even if so, you could be proud that you didn't make it [easy for them](https://www.businessinsider.com/hawaii-emergency-agency-password-discovered-in-photo-sparks-security-criticism-2018-1).

## The Plan

- USE A DEDICATED PASSWORD MANAGER. Bonus points if you double blind.
- Only click trusted links.
- Always use 2 factor authentication.
- Backup your files. Bonus points for 2 backups.
- Give Less Info Out
- Never, ever use public wifi.
- Be extra if you want.

### Password Manager

The idea is that you have one very strong password to get into the password manager and the password manager safely stores (encrypts) all your passwords.

The password manager generates unique, difficult to hack passwords for your accounts. This is far superior to reusing the same password or variations of it. [Learn why](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+shouldn%27t+i+resue+passwords).

Here's a [list](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers). I usually recommend [1Password](https://1password.com/) and [Last Pass](https://www.lastpass.com/).

Your browser does have the option of saving and generating passwords. [Don't use it](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+you+shouldn%27t+use+your+browser+as+your+password+manager&oq=why+you+shouldn%27t+use+your+browser+as+your+password+manager).

#### Bonus: Double Blind

I love double blinds because they ease my concern that one day, my password manager company will get hacked. They claim they're super duper secure, but I assume all companies will get popped eventually. It is called a double blind because neither you nor the password manager knows the full password.

Making a double blind:

- Your manager generates and remembers a password for an account.
- When update your password on that account, you use the generated password PLUS a short personal password.

Here's a good [video](https://youtu.be/YNvaf9UzZh4?t=185) explaining password managers and double blinds.

For the short personal password, you can use the same one over and over. But you can get extra with it too, more on that at the end.

This also makes me feel more comfortable about finger print authorization for the password manager app on my phone. If I'm unconscious (I've been [chloroformed](https://static.blog4ever.com/2016/05/817923/artfichier_817923_6935109_201702163943888.png)!) and someone unlocks the password manager on my phone with my finger print, they would have access to all my passwords AND the second factor of authentication. A double blind means they wouldn't have those passwords.

### Only Click Trusted Links

This is the computer version of practicing safe sex. Clicking bad links in messages is the number one way people are scamming other people out of money and / or compromising their systems. It is called [phishing](https://www.knowbe4.com/phishing) and it is really common.

I know people who have taken advantage of by phishing scams like these. There's a whole genre on YouTube of hackers [hacking back](https://youtu.be/RpwQObHEOjI?t=477) scammers.

The solution to this is to ~~fix the economic disparities that encourage people to become scammers in the first place~~ always login from the main site. For example you get a message saying you have suspicious account activity on your PayPal account. Legit or not, don't log in from the link provided in the message. Go to paypal.com directly using your browser.

I actually am pretty extra about this and only click on clicks from friends and family that I'm expecting. And if I'm not expecting the link, I'll verify with them verbally that they sent it before I open it.

### 2 Factor Authentication

Use it whenever possible.

> 2FA is essential to web security because it immediately neutralizes the risks associated with compromised passwords. If a password is hacked, guessed, or even phished, that's no longer enough to give an intruder access: without approval at the second factor, a password alone is useless.

Source: [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/information-security/why-use-2fa/#:~:text=2FA%20is%20essential%20to%20web,a%20password%20alone%20is%20useless).

[More info](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+use+2+factor+authentication).

One additional note. If for whatever reason you're not going to use it, keep in mind if your account *does* get hacked, the attacker will turn it on and make their device the 2nd factor. This will make it extremely hard for you to get your account back.

### Backup Your Files

Backup all your files in the cloud with dropbox, google drive, apple cloud, or whatever service you like. My preference is that the service also tracks revision history.

If your computer is physically destroyed in a [fire](https://oaklandside.org/2021/10/19/podcast-1991-oakland-berkeley-firestorm-tunnel-fire/), you have a backup. If your files are maliciously encrypted, you can roll back the version history in the cloud and restore them.

For several years I debated using this kind of backup for all my files because I have ~ 175 gb of stuff and to back that much up I'd have to pay for a subscription. I don't like subscriptions, I prefer set costs. Now that I'm doing it, it is so easy and convenient I'd never give it up.

#### Bonus: 2nd Backup

Maybe my cloud backup goes down and automatically deletes all my local files too. Or someone steals my computer, hacks my computer login, and deletes everything locally and in the cloud.  Or maybe there's new malware that encrypts all the revisions in my cloud service. I know I know, seems improbable, but I worry. That's why this one is bonus.

There are really good and convenient services now to backup your files onto a second hard drive. You can also encrypt that hard drive. I do this once a week while I'm doing laundry. Here's one way to do it for [MacOS](https://www.google.com/search?q=time+machine+mac).

### Give Less Info Out

I never give my social security number to hospitals (anymore). They are notoriously bad at securing the information in their care. While they ask for it, they don't need it and I'm not legally obliged to give it (in the USA).

If I'm making a purchase for... basketball tickets and the ticket website asks me for my name and birthday, I give them a fake ones. They're  asking for marketing purposes, but I know they won't be securing it well. The tickets don't come with my name on them!

### Never Use Public WiFi

Public WiFi may be convenient but I think of it like texting and driving. The risk isn't worth it and it can probably wait.

## Words of Encouragement

You can do this! I know it is overwhelming to do everything at once. What worked for me was doing the plan over time and in order if priority.

- Priority accounts: money, identity, work, primary email. Loose these and you loose all your money or your reputation.
- Secondary accounts: these have sensitive information, but if compromised wouldn't completely wreck your life.
- Tertiary accounts: meh services, but they have your birthday, name, phone number, etc.

### Other Considerations

If your significant other isn't as into this as you, get yourself secure first. Then, help them secure at least their primary accounts with a password manager and 2FA.

For at family businesses with a few people, there are group versions of password managers and you can educate them with [phishing tests](https://www.knowbe4.com/). Just don't make your test in [bad taste](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/10/train-firms-worker-bonus-email-is-actually-cyber-security-test) like the train company that emailed staff to promise a bonus to workers who had run trains during the pandemic

## Getting Extra

Here are a few ideas.

#### Super Double Blind

For your double blinds, make them unique and remember them with a cueing technique. One technique might be using the name of the service and adding it to an anagram.

i.e.
 
```
I love to use bank of america =>
Il2uboa

I love to use wells fargo =>
Il2uwf
```

#### Safety Deposit Boxes

Store your master password in a bank's safety deposit box. And your double blind cue pattern in a different bank's safety deposit box. Make sure to add how to get into those in your will!

#### VPN

Use one.

#### Your Home Router

Change your home router's default admin username and password. This isn't all that extra to be honest. You should do this. I just didn't want to overwhelm in the main body of the article.

Change your home router's firewall outbound traffic rules to only-permitted instead of all-permitted and update them as needed. [More info](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/firewall/ingress-egress.html#egress-filtering).

#### Remote Access

Enable remote tracking i.e. find my computer / phone services. 

Setup the ability to securely and remotely manage your computer / phone.
