                <h4>Assignment</h4>

                <ul>
                <li>remove the friction in my web authoring process</li>
                <li>without a cms or similar (Wordpress, Blogger, Squarespace)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Context</h4>

                <p>I wanted to write about the process behind the projects I'm doing. Using HTML to markup diverse text that includes code blocks, multiple headers, lists and other elements, is a dauntingly time consuming proposition. Doubly so to keep it consistent from one writeup to another.</p>

                <p>After some research, markdown seemed the appropriate solution.</p>

                <h4>Process</h4>

                <ol>
                <li><p>Write in markdown<br/>
                Can be done in any basic text editor and a little help from a <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">syntax cheat sheet</a>.</p></li>
                <li><p>Export as html<br/>
                There are free tools to convert markdown to html online. I wanted something with even less friction and a few more tools. <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA writer</a> fit the bill for me.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add html to site page<br/>
                Easy peasy. I made a template for process pages and now I could copy and paste the html into the appropriate div location.</p></li>
                <li><p>Style<br/>
                This is where things got tricky. From my project log:</p>

                <blockquote>
                <p>Wow, ok, 4 is not handled. Styling that HTML to look like what it does in iA or on GitHub is NOT going to be easy. I do feel like this is a stepping off point where it isn't about making it all myself, that I should learn how to install someone else's work. That way I can focus on my contribution instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/tuzz/3331384">Chris Patuzzo's work</a> was the solution. He wrote CSS that replicates GitHub's styling of markdown.</p>

                <p>After a couple tweaks, it was the perfect solution.</p></li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>

                <p>Looking back at the system, because it is so simple, it seems really underwhelming. Did this really take me 5 hours?</p>

                <p>Looking at my project log, yes. And I needed it. It wasn't easy to arrive at a simple system that fit my needs. Every step of the process took research and testing.</p>

                <p>But now, authoring content is very low friction. I write with markdown in iA writer, copy and paste the HTML, and push to GitHub why my site is displayed via GitHub pages. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
