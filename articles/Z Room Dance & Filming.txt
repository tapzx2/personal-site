# Z Room Dance & Filming

In 2015 my wife and I bought a dance studio. Like most studios, it was organized around a central teacher who was the driving force of marketing and teaching. We found it was not sustainable or scalable.

We changed the business model.

As dancer teachers ourselves we had rented space and always found the process difficult. Generally, dancers just want to teach. They don't want to fill out insurance forms, have lengthy back and forth conversations about when are available times, or heaven forbid, pay with a cheque. The Z Room makes it easy to get a creative space at a low cost.

We are actively searching for a location to open a third studio.
