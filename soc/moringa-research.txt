My moringa have red spider mites because the trees are stressed. I'm posting here looking for:

1) Successful first hand experience dealing with red spider mites, specifically on moringa tress.
2) Ways Phoenix (or similar climate) growers reduce stress on trees (besides a well, mulch, and exposing root flair).

Research so far:

DISEASE

Confirmed it is Red Spider Mites on Trees:

Suggested Courses of Action
1. Do Nothing
2. Spray Mites with Water x2 a Week
3. Prune Aggressively
4. Repot (not applicable)
5. Spray with non pesticides (i.e. Neem)
6. True Poisons (one that kills mites, not insects)

"Patricio and Palada (2017) observed red mites (Tetranyctrus urticia),	defoliator, leaffooted bug (Leptoglossus phyllospus) and whiteflies	 (Bermisia sp.) in the field during an adaptability and horticultural	 trial with a large number of moringa accessions in the
Philippines and mentioned that the insects cause little damage to the plants."

Confirms red mites are a major pest.

STRESS

"Compared to trees planted from seed, trees from stem cuttings grow faster but develop a shallow root system that makes them more susceptible to moisture stress and wind damage."

But all my trees are seed grown.

"Mite populations can increase during dry and cool weather. These pests create yellowing of leaves, but plants usually recover during warm weather."

Weather is currently dry, but certainly not cool.

Plants can handle water stress, but it causes growth reductions.

Not much on stress out there, so what are ideal conditions?

IDEAL CONDITONS

"Moringa trees grow best in temperatures between 77-86 degrees F. (25-30 C.) and will tolerate some light frosts. Moringa prefers well-drained sandy or loam soil with a neutral pH level. Though it tolerates clay soil, it cannot be water logged."

"Direct exposure to sunlight, warmth and water with loamy soil is crucial for this tree. For those who live in the United States, particularly the southern and western states, you are in luck and can grow Moringa outdoors. Within the United States, we believe that Moringa grows well in Hardiness Zones 9 and 10 outdoors. With the right conditions, it can grow in Zone 8 as well."

"Moringa needs a bare minimum of 6 hours of daily sunlight, but prefers full sun conditions year-round. As a subtropical beauty, it’s accustomed to warm weather conditions, making it best to grow in the United States in zones 9-10.

While they’re drought-resistant once well established, moringa still needs water to survive. It’s accustomed to high air moisture of the sort typically found in jungles, and in humid areas it will thrive. But you’ll still need to water consistently.

Watering deeply is better than a quick shallow watering at the tree’s base. You can do this with a soaker hose, and the gradual dripping of moisture into the soil will fully hydrate it. Otherwise, water at least once a week when it’s not raining, and increase watering frequency as the heat goes up.

Moringa trees prefer loose loamy or sandy soils as these types offer the best conditions for the root to develop deeply into the ground or potting mix. Loose soil will also ensure good drainage.  Although the trees can survive in poor soil or clay soil, it’s best to stick to loamy. 

Growing moringa requires enriched soil, which is why you should add compost or manure every now and then. Spread a 2-3” layer of compost around the base of the tree to the width of the tree’s canopy. The plants work best in slightly acidic or neutral soils that have a pH between 6.5-7.5"

The Don says: Moringa need no care, stop worrying.


Summation:
1. Get soil closer to neutral.
2. Try watering more.
3. Try watering less.
